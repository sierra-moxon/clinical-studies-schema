      quantity:

        description: To find the dose form of a drug the RELATIONSHIP table can be used where the relationship_id is ‘Has dose form’. If liquid, quantity stands for the total amount dispensed or ordered of ingredient in the units given by the drug_strength table. If the unit from the source data does not align with the unit in the DRUG_STRENGTH table the quantity should be converted to the correct unit given in DRUG_STRENGTH. For clinical drugs with fixed dose forms (tablets etc.) the quantity is the number of units/tablets/capsules prescribed or dispensed (can be partial, but then only 1/2 or 1/3, not 0.01). Clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (injections) the quantity is the amount of ingredient the patient got. For example, if the injection is 2mg/mL but the patient got 80mL then quantity is reported as 160. Quantified clinical drugs with divisible dose forms (prefilled syringes), the quantity is the amount of ingredient similar to clinical drugs. Please see [how to calculate drug dose](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/drug_dose.html) for more information.

        comments: The field should be left empty if the source data does not contain a verbatim days_supply, and should not be calculated from other fields.  Negative values are not allowed. If the source has negative days supply the record should be dropped as it is unknown if the patient actually took the drug. Several actions are possible -- record is not trustworthy and we remove the record entirely; we trust the record and leave days_supply empty; or record needs to be combined with other record (e.g. reversal of prescription). High values (>365 days) should be investigated. If considered an error in the source data (e.g. typo), the value needs to be excluded to prevent creation of unrealistic long eras.

    comments:
    - QuantityMeasure may be implemented as an Observation-like object that will let us capture any type of measure of the amount of some substance (e.g. "weight", "volume"), with distinct timestamps and methods associated.  It could be implemented as a "simple" observation (one measurement per instance, where the "code" fields is bound to a value set describing the different types of quantity measures allowed -  e.g. "weight", "volume", "concentration"),  or as "composite" observation (multiple measurements possible in a single instance, each captured as a component defined to hold a specific type of quantity measure - e.g.  "weight", "volume", "concentration").  The number of different quantity measures we anticipate needed to support, and the potential for data sparseness, are factors that determine whether a simple or composite Observation would be most appropriate.
